**`date-calculator`**

This macro adds a given number of days to a date. Its intended purpose is to help write or QC dates, e.g., in patient safety narratives. It calculates future dates based on the selected text plus the user-provided number of days. The output is displayed in "dd-mmm-yyyy" format. The macro provides both the inclusive and non-inclusive end date.
